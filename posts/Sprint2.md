This week I focused specifically on completing the wireframe and researching how to implement authentication and protection of sensitive info and here's what I learned...

## Wireframing

I wanted to climb into Adobe XD this week so I decided to take the tutorial that is available in the application. It is a quick little jaunt through the interface that actually touches on quite a bit in a short storyboard style walk-through. It's short and straight to the point and it left me feeling loads more confident about using XD for my wireframes and prototypes.
