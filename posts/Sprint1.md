This week I focused specifically on wireframe and logo creation and here's what I learned...

## Wireframing

Figma is an amazing tool for creating the bare-bones wireframe. It works in a similar fashion to illustrator or photoshop. It allows you to work on multiple layers and create groups and the list goes on. It's definitely worth a try!

## Logo Design

For logo design I paired up with Dandy who uses Adobe Illustrator for his graphic design. It is such a powerful tool and an industry standard for a reason. We collected all of the design ideas from our team and tried to take the best from each of them, Ayana found some great stuff in the way of electrical towers which we felt really showcased in a simple and clean way that we are an app specifically geared towards digital art. Earlier in the week we had already come up with our brand's color palette so we through in our popy colors for the design and we are quite happy with what we came up with.
