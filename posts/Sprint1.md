This week I focused specifically on wireframe and logo creation and here's what I learned...

## Wireframing

Figma is an amazing tool for creating the bare-bones wireframe. It works in a similar fashion to illustrator or photoshop. It allows you to work on multiple layers and create groups and the list goes on. It's definitely worth a try!

## Logo Design

For logo design I paired up with Dandy who uses Adobe Illustrator for his graphic design. It is such a powerful tool and an industry standard for a reason. We collected all of the design ideas from our team and tried to take the best from each of them, Ayana found some great stuff in the way of electrical towers which we felt really showcased in a simple and clean way that we are an app specifically geared towards digital art. Earlier in the week we had already come up with our brand's color palette so we through in our popy colors for the design and we are quite happy with what we came up with.

## Difficulties This Week

Personal

I had a couple learning curves personally because I have never worked with Figma or Adobe XD so I felt like my design and creative processes were slowed to about half my normal speed. Fortunately, Dandy Reyes (A great dude and a wonderful developer on the team) is an XD poweruser and was able to bear most of the weight of implementation while I worked more as a creative thought leader. Aside from XD, I was able to spend enough time working in Figma to get the hang of it. 

Team

We are starting to get the hang of communication and organization but we still have a few hiccups every so often. Sometimes we are saying the same thing but coming from different angles and it takes some time to sort that out. We all have different styles of communication and that can be a hinderance but it also leads to some off the path discoveries as we walk through it all. 

Issue Creation and Organization

Fortunately we have GitHub to save us from ourselves. Our instructors helped us set up a decent project and repo set up along with issue cards. We are still working out a few bugs with branch protection and pull requests, it's really just about getting a few weeks with the system under our belts. It's all muscle memory, baby!

## Overview

I'm so excited about this project. I love my team, I love getting into the creative flow and I am genuinely excited to use this app once it's finished.
